# Malicious-URL-Classifier
This project primarily focuses on the development of a Python based Malicious URL Classifier that automatically identifies and categorizes the URLs as either safe or malicious using machine learning technology.

Main Objective/Deliverable:
• To develop a machine learning based classifier that predicts whether a URL is safe or malicious.
• To pre-process and analyse the URL dataset, extracting meaningful features for classification
• To train the model and evaluate using different algorithms such as (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes)
• To deliver a complete working prototype, source code, sample output and documentation.
• To provide visual output using graphs and reports of model performance and prediction results.

Timeline and Milestones:
(may include course enrolment, phases of project planning to do... etc)


1 Topic selection, proposal approval and basic environmental setup Week 1–2
2 Researching on phishing techniques, URL features, and ML algorithms to be used Week 3–4
3 Collect and preprocess publicly available datasets (malicious and safe URLs both) Week 5–6
4 Implement the feature extraction and train initial ML models Week 7–8
5 Evaluate the performance, tune hyperparameters, and visualize results Week 9–10
6 Integrate results into Python script with reporting module Week 11–12
7 Prepare final documentation, screenshots, and final report Week 13–14
8 Finalize demo video, presentation slides, and submission for approval Week 15–16
